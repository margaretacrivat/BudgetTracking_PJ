![Budget Tracking Homepage](static/assets/img/budget_tracking_homepage.jpg)

## About:
I have developed a client-facing web application using Django framework. This web application is designed to help 
users manage both personal budget and project-associated budget, all centralized within a single virtual environment. 
The goal is to provide users with a comprehensive tool to track their expenses, set budget limits, and analyze their 
financial data.

**Key Features**:

- Track income and expense;
- Generate financial reports;
- Visualize data with charts;

## Features extended:
- **Personal Budget Management**: Users can create, view, and manage their personal budgets, tracking income and 
- expenses across various categories.
- **Project Budget Management**: Users can also manage budgets for specific projects, allowing them to allocate funds, 
- track expenditures, and monitor financial progress for individual projects.
- **Centralized Dashboard**: A single, user-friendly dashboard provides an overview of all budgets, with visualizations 
- and summary statistics to help users quickly understand their financial status.
- **Expense and Income Tracking**: Users can log and categorize expenses and income, ensuring accurate tracking and reporting.
- **Budget Analysis**: The application offers analytical tools to help users identify spending patterns and make 
- informed financial decisions.
